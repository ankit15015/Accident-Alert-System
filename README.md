## Introduction
Vehicle use has increased over the last few decades. Day-to-day growing use of cars has increased the traffic hazards and road accidents. The country's emergency services are not adequate and there is a shortage of evidence of immediate medical assistance and, as a result, people's lives are at high risk. Living environment considerations are not only about people's lifestyle, but also about transportation. If an individual drives a vehicle and he / she encounters an accident, it may be that the individual may suffer minor injury or that the individual may also encounter a fatal accident. This system is a solution to the problem as it serves as an accident detection and warning device that gathers and sends information about the vehicle that has encountered an accident, and transmits it to the nearest police control room and ambulance. This project concerns a system that detects an accident and alerts the nearest rescue team and emergency contacts to the accident. The system is going to be accidents. The system will raise an alarm when an accident is detected
