## Introduction
Vehicle use has increased over the last few decades. Day-to-day growing use of cars has increased the traffic hazards and road accidents. The country's emergency services are not adequate and there is a shortage of evidence of immediate medical assistance and, as a result, people's lives are at high risk. Living environment considerations are not only about people's lifestyle, but also about transportation. If an individual drives a vehicle and he / she encounters an accident, it may be that the individual may suffer minor injury or that the individual may also encounter a fatal accident. This system is a solution to the problem as it serves as an accident detection and warning device that gathers and sends information about the vehicle that has encountered an accident, and transmits it to the nearest police control room and ambulance. This project concerns a system that detects an accident and alerts the nearest rescue team and emergency contacts to the accident. The system is going to be accidents. The system will raise an alarm when an accident is detected

## Problem Statement
The main problem that we face every day is the accidents on the streets, the highways. The number of accidents is increasing due to population growth, the high speed of the new advanced cars and the use of mobile telephones while driving for calling or text. Many people have died in a disused highway because they have an accident, and no one is helping. Another scenario where the person who has the accident is unable to reach out for help or call the ambulance because he / she was injured, either he / she is not awake and helpless or the accident occurred on an inaccessible road or away from the neighborhoods. However, if the incident occurs in the area, where there are plenty of cars in the street that can create crowding if the emergency services are late. We find the time to be a very important element in preserving the lives of others. Owing to lateness we could lose many lives. Consequently, the problem in this work has to do with reducing the significant number of deaths resulting from the traffic accidents and caused mainly due to the lack or latency of assisting the injured person

## Solution 
The model acts as an accident avoidance and detection system that gathers all the information and calls the ambulance and also its provides an ALERT message if you enter into an accidental zone and app suggests nearby accidental zone while travelling, Our application gives statistical report based on accidents occured in a month and if user enters into a false ALARM/Detection then our app provides 1/2 minute to cancel. Our model is safe and reliable.

## How it works
Our prototype which contain Arduino sensors Such as Vibration Sensor, GSM Sensor and a GPS Location Finder Sensor.
Prototype will be installed on the vehicle at maximum suspicious locations so that it can easily detect if any misshaping took place. Assuming any accident took place and the sensor detects, it will directly share the Vehicle location to the nearby Ambulance as well as Hospitals. Sending Requests from the sensor to the server is automated.On receiving information, the ambulance/Hospital will get information about the incident with GPRS Location. They can easily Navigate and reach to Victim.
